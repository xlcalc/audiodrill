<font size=+1><i>Repetitio est mater studiorum. </i></font>Repetition is the mother of learning. 
If you believe in this maxim, use Audiodrill to teach or learn languages. Learners can benefit from listening to video/audio fragments at a <strong>chosen playback speed</strong> and repeating after the speaker. Listening and speaking can be looped. 

No need to seek the start of the fragment every time you wish to replay - just set the number of repetitions. You can <strong>compare your pronunciation</strong> with that in the video by recording and replaying your speech right in the loop - just tick the <i>Record/replay speech</i> checkbox under the video. 

<strong>Interactive tasks</strong> make user's life easier. They offer the following functionality:

&nbsp; • cloze and multiple choice quizzes
