My name is Dzmitry Rabkin, and I'm an English teacher. I created the free tool [Audiodrill](https://audiodrill.com) to help language learners develop their listening and speaking skills.

I come from Belarus but currently live in Poland, and I'm grateful to the Polish authorities for allowing me to stay and work there. I left Belarus because of the government's terror against the Belarusian people. In my home country, financial support of the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](https://bank.gov.ua/en/about/support-the-armed-forces/), civic initiatives like [BY_help](https://www.voiceofbelarus.com/pl/employment-instead-of-payments/), [Bysol](https://racyja.com/pl/spoleczenstwo/bysol-wzrost-liczby-wnioskow-do-pomoc/), or [Partyzanka](https://partyzanka.org/media-coverage) foundations, sharing links to media, e.g. TV channel [Belsat](/task.html?t=/tasklist/live-tv.txt&stream=YA9ukP4k_Fk), radio stations [Racyja](/task.html?t=/tasklist/live-radio.txt&stream=https://air.racyja.com/racja48), [Svoboda](/task.html?t=/tasklist/live-radio.txt&stream=https://stream.radiojar.com/hcrb063nn3quv), or [Human Rights Center Viasna (Spring)](https://spring96.org/en) is considered extremist by the Belarusian regime, and even writing that you disagree with the neo-Bolshevik dictator Lukashenko is a crime. This is what I actually do, which is why I'm at risk of criminal prosecution in Belarus. Furthermore, prisoners are subjected to inhumane treatment and torture in prisons.

*The following facts and figures confirm the risk of persecution in Belarus due to such actions*, therefore I've applied for international protection.

 *Massive political repression in Belarus following the 2020 elections (<https://tvn24.pl/swiat/libereco-od-czasu-sfalszowanych-wyborow-na-bialorusi-w-2020-roku-zatrzymano-tam-ponad-38-tysiecy-osob-st7069680>).

 *Between 2020 and 2024, over 1,200 people were convicted of "slandering" and "insulting" Lukashenko (<https://spring96.org/en/news/116690>).

 *Over the same period, over 90 people have been convicted of donating to "extremist organizations," and hundreds have been forced to pay large sums of money for the promise not to be prosecuted (<https://spring96.org/ru/news/114762>).

 *The Belarusian KGB has been checking donor lists via Facebook since August 2020 (<https://nashaniva-com.translate.goog/ru/307390?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en>).

 *As of February 24, 2025, at least 209 people have been convicted of supporting Ukraine (<https://spring96.org/en/news/117504>).
